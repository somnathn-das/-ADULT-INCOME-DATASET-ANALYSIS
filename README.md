# -ADULT-INCOME-DATASET-ANALYSIS
Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das. I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my fourth project in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. I designed an engaging dashboard using Python that allows for the monitoring and analysis of the ADULT INCOME DATASET ANALYSIS. So, let's dive deep into the project and provide some analysis.

PROJECT LEARNINGS:-
1. PERFORMED DATA CLEANING AND MANIPULATION.
2. PERFORMED EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) USING PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN LIBRARIES.
3. PERFORMED FINDING NULL VALUES IN THE DATASET.
4. PERFORMED DROPPING SOME VALUES IN THE DATASET.
5. PERFORMED HOW TO FIND UNIQUE VALUES IN THE DATASET.
6. PERFORMED HOW TO USE REPLACE METHOD IN THE DATASET.
7. PERFORMED ISIN METHOD IN THE DATASET TO GET THE VALUES.
8. CONVERT COLUMNS DATATYPE TO CATEGORY TYPE.
9. PERFORMED BETWEEN METHOD IN THE DATASET TO GET THE VALUE.
10. PERFORMED BIVARIATE ANALYSIS.

INSIGHTS:-
1. AS WE CAN SEE THE HEATMAP, THERE ARE NO MISSING VALUES IN THE DATASET. IF MISSING VALUES ARE THERE, IT WILL SHOW LIGHTER COLOR.
2. AS WE CAN SEE 75% VALUES OF CAPITAL-GAIN AND CAPITAL-LOSS ARE ZERO. IT SAME GOES FOR 50% AND 25%.
3. IN THE HISTOGRAM, WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE AGE VALUES ARE FROM 17 TO 48.
4. 23320 NUMBER OF PERSONS HAVING AGE BETWEEN 17 TO 48 INCLUSIVE.
5. IN THE SECOND HISTOGRAM, WE CAN SEE THAT THE MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE FROM PRIVATE SECTOR.
6. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AND SALARY, WE CAN SEE IN THE BOX-PLOT DIAGRAM, MOST OF THE WHO ARE PEOPLE ARE YOUNGER HAVING SALARY LESS THAN 50K.
7. SELF-EMPLOYED GETTING THE HIGHEST SALARY.
8. MALE IS HAVING BETTER CHANCE TO GET SALARY GREATER THAN 50K.
9. WE CAN SEE THAT AFTER CONVERTING WORK-CLASS COLUMNS DATATYPE TO CATEGORY DATATYPE THE MEMORY USAGE REDUCE TO 4.5+MB TO 4.2+MB.Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das.
